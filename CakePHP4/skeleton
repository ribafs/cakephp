Meu Esqueleto do CakePHP 4

Hospedar no GH e Packagist

- Instalar cakephp 4

composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app:~4.0 cake4-skeleton

- Algumas configurações no app_local.php:
    'Datasources' => [
        'default' => [
            'host' => 'localhost',
            'username' => 'root',
            'password' => '',
            'database' => 'testes',

Plugins e componentes que já vem no core:

Indicar tutorial meu no GH

- composer require cakephp/acl

bin/cake plugin load Acl

Criar tabelas
composer require cakephp/migrations "@stable"
bin/cake plugin load Migrations

bin/cake migrations migrate -p Acl

Attaching the behavior

Add the Acl behavior to your table so it will automatically create an aco whenever a new record is saved:

public function initialize(array $config)
{
    parent::initialize($config);

    $this->addBehavior('Acl.Acl', ['controlled']);
}

Updating the entity

Before you can start using the behavior, you MUST add the parentNode() method to the corresponding Entity file or the AclBehavior will not be able to determine the parent->child relationships. Also make make sure the method returns either null or a parent Model reference.

public function parentNode() {
    return null;
}

    If things went well you should now see an entry appearing in the acos database table whenever you save a new record.
