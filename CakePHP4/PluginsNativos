Authentication

The authentication plugin integrates with your application as a middleware. It can also be used as a component to make unauthenticated access simpler.
composer require "cakephp/authentication:^2.0"

Load no src/Application.php
public function bootstrap(): void
{
    parent::bootstrap();

    $this->addPlugin('Authentication');
}

Authorization

composer require "cakephp/authorization:^2.0"

src/Application.php:

$this->addPlugin('Authorization');

The Authorization plugin integrates into your application as a middleware layer and optionally a component to make checking authorization easier.

Migrations
Migrations is a plugin supported by the core team that helps you do schema changes in your database by writing PHP files that can be tracked using your version control system.
composer require cakephp/migrations "@stable"
bin/cake plugin load Migrations
https://book.cakephp.org/migrations/3/en/index.html

Phinx
Phinx makes it ridiculously easy to manage the database migrations for your PHP app. In less than 5 minutes, you can install Phinx using Composer and create your first database migration. Phinx is just about migrations without all the bloat of a database ORM system or application framework.

composer require robmorgan/phinx
Create folders in your project following the structure db/migrations with adequate permissions. It is where your migration files will live and should be writable.

Phinx can now be executed from within your project:
vendor/bin/phinx init
https://book.cakephp.org/phinx/0/en/index.html

Chronos
Chronos provides a zero-dependency collection of extensions to the DateTime object. In addition to convenience methods, Chronos provides:

    Date objects for representing calendar dates.

    Immutable date and datetime objects.

    A pluggable translation system. Only English translations are included in the library. However, cakephp/i18n can be used for full language support.
composer require "cakephp/chronos:^2.0"
